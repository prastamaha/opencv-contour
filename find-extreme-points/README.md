# Finding extreme points in contours

## our goal
- find the large object
- draw contour on the object
- find the most left, right, top, buttom pixel in the contour (extreme point)
- draw circle on each extreme point

## Run the code
```
$ python find-extreme-points.py --image input.jpg
```

## Image For Testing
![test](input.jpg)

## Output
